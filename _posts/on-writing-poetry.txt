I think that I shall try to write
a poem every day.
But I will not attempt to try
to write one every way.

For some techniques are very good,
but others very worse,
when daily trying to compose
a novel piece of verse.

For instance, sitting in a chair
and typing to a screen,
is easier than painting words
onto a lima bean.

It's easier, for me at least,
to go from left to right,
and so much harder in the dark
than writing in the light.

I also tend to write my words
in languages I know,
which leaves out Latin, French and Greek,
and German, High and Low.

And when I write a funny verse
I always try to rhyme
(You'd know this if you read the thing
I posted that one time).

I'll never write a poem
while I'm running from a bear,
or while a midget barber
washes, cuts, and dyes my hair.

No, never while I'm sleeping,
and seldom in the rain,
not when I wear a hard hat
and operate a crane.

And not to mention all the forms
I carefully eschew
Like sonnets, odes, and limericks
and Japanese haiku.

I'm just a simple rhymer,
and I'm quite set in my ways.
But that won't stop me writing
all the length and breadth of days.
