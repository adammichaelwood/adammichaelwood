O Lord, who are the author of ever-living life, and the source of all wonder and mystery, bless, recognize, and approve these words, these clauses, these holy and undefiled enunciations, we humbly pray,
both dependent and independent,
which we offer you first of all on behalf of your Church,
that by the anticipation of their conclusions, 
long forestalled by the mysterious work of your servants who,
holding to the truth, handed them to us,
and by the sincere searching for their venerable antecedents,
we, though pitiable in our ignorance 
and darkened by the stain of sin, 
may come circuitously to the understanding of that enlightening grace 
by which you make your miraculous salvation known 
to all who speak, hear, and rightly understand the sacredness of these, 
your most holy and auspicious words.
