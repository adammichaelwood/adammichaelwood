Reared and raised on Seuss, was I,
what form! what grace! oh me, oh my.

And Shakespeare, too, and old King Jim
(the Good Book that was named for him)

Such art we had when we were young-
what books we read! what songs were sung!

Do children now, in growing years,
rhyme their laughter, sing their tears?

They must, and you must make it so,
with bookshelves full, and Sundays slow.

Forget not all you dreamed and read,
when laying children down to bed.
