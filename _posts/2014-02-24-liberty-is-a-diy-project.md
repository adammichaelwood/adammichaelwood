author: Adam Michael Wood
description: This book is amazing and everybody should read it.

Finished reading Jeffrey Tuckerï»¿'s new book, Liberty is a DIY Project, last night.
 
 
### First - A Mild Critique

Many of the individual pieces were written as events were unfolding (commentary on Snowden case, developments in Bitcoin, etc), but no context (even a date) is provided, so it seems a little weird and rootless in places. 

This is mostly okay because this was a [Liberty.me](http://liberty.me) preview, and I think most of us reading it have some context for these things already, and are familiar with Jeffrey's writing. 

But - if there is to be a second edition, or a general-audience release, it might be a good idea to clean this up a bit.

Okay - that aside:

### This Book is Amazing<br/>&amp; Everybody Should Read It 
 
 
#### The Subject Matter is Amazing

JT is describing a new world that is still in the process of being discovered and created. THAT WORLD is amazing. 

The things people are doing, the books people are writing, the ideas people are coming up with, the inventions people are inventing, the businesses people are starting.

It's all so incredible.

#### The Amazingness is amazingly communicated

Tucker is perfect for this job. 

The stuff - the subject matter - is amazing and fascinating. But that's only if you understand what's going on, and can piece together how all these various things are connected. JT gets it - he sees the big picture - and is able to communicate it in a straightforward manner, in a way that transmits the amazingness of it all. 

I know lots of people who can explain HOW Bitcoin works (for example). Tucker explains WHY it works, and WHY we should care. And he does this not for one or two isolated technologies or trends. He brings this ability to pretty much every major development and cultural trend of the last hundred years. Phenomenal.

#### The Book as a Product, and more...

The book itself is boundary-breaking, blithely ignoring both what you were taught about books in school and what passes for "common knowledge" among traditional book publishers. 

For one thing, almost every single essay has already appeared somewhere online for free. Who would want to read a book of old blog posts? It makes no sense. 

It defies categories: is it a product that I would want to pay for? Is it a marketing artifact for Liberty.me? Yes to both. And the original articles and posts online - they are both a development environment for the content and a marketing device for the book (and online community).


#### Jeffrey Tucker Writes Like a Hacker

The book is imperfect. And I mean that as a compliment. 

There's typos. There's some weird sentences that don't make any sense a year after they were originally written. There's that context thing I mentioned above. 

But... so what?

I don't mean at all that the book is sloppy or anything. It's not like there's some chronic grammar deficiency or something. There's just - you know - the usual imperfections you'd see in an advanced, but not final, draft.

In the days of hard copies, limited production runs, and ur-text definitive editions, it made good sense to spend a lot of money, energy, and time sanding down all these little editorial splinters. 

But Jeffrey Tucker writes essays the way hackers write software: release early, release often, and optimize later. 

While the fussbudgets are poo-pooing an extra comma or a misspelled word, Tucker is forging ahead, exploring the next thought, the next idea. There's always a next release; bugs can be dealt with in a patch or an update. Or (like real hackers) people can just get around them, ignore them, or fix it themselves.

I find this approach to writing to be truly amazing.

For one thing, it allows Tucker both the time and the mental energy to be continuously on the advanced front line. 

Moreover, it takes some real intellectual bravery to focus on the dangerous thing (cutting-edge content) instead of on the safe thing (fixing grammar and spelling). 

Most writers (myself included) don't have the guts for this, and we re-read and re-edit our work toward unattainable "perfection," instead of being out there doing what we should be doing: figuring shit out and telling people about it.
