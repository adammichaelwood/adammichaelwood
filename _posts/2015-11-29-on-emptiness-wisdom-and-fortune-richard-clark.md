title: "<i>On Emptiness, Wisdom, and Fortune</i> with Richard Clark"
author: Adam Michael Wood
---

My friend the composer [Richard Clark](http://www.rjcceciliamusic.com/) recently used excerpts of two of my poems, [On Fortune](http://adammichaelwood.com/on-fortune/) and [On Emptiness](http://adammichaelwood.com/on-emptiness/), as the basis for a choral work he title [On Emptiness, Wisdom, and Fortune](https://youtu.be/NBDXuLBURlI).

The piece was commissioned by the [Seraphim Singers](http://www.seraphimsingers.org/), who premiered it in October of 2015.

Here is a recording of that performance.
