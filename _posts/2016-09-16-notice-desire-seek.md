Where do you look?

When you look, what do you see?

When you see, what do you notice?

When you notice, what do you desire?

When you desire, what do you seek?

When you seek, where do you look?

I am convinced that misogyny and sexist aggression is not, ultimately, rooted in hatred of women or femininity. Indeed, I don't think it is rooted in hatred at all. The hatred and violence are real, but they are not the cause --- they are the result of a perverse cycle of desire in which the violent aggressor looks in the wrong places, notices the wrong attributes, desires the wrong actions, and seeks the wrong outcomes.

This cycle of perversion is most obviously on display when it manifests as sexual aggression, so that will be the focus of this essay. However, it is also the force behind acquisitive greed, religious fanaticism, and violent political ambition --- I will touch on these as well. It may, ultimately, be the cycle that drives all sin.

The key, then, to eliminating sexual aggression --- and, if I am right, most forms of oppressive violence --- is to disrupt this perverse cycle of desire. This can only be done by instilling rightly ordered desire for that which is good, true, and beautiful.
