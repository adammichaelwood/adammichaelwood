How I wish that I was rich.
I'm certain I could be,
If I was more ambitious
and didn't watch TV.

I waste away the hours
getting less than nothing done
enjoying gameshows, movies,
and old favorites on rerun.

I also sleep in every day,
I'm just so often tired.
But when it comes to getting rich,
I'm really quite inspired.

I have a lot of good ideas
for bringing money in,
things to sell, invent, or build,
whole industries to win.

And I were a rich man
I wouldn't be a jerk.
I'd be generous and quit my job
So someone else could work.

If I could only focus,
how wealthy I could be.
And then I could relax,
and spend all day watching TV.
