The conception behind minimum wage laws - and any similar notion that supposes that employees should receive payment or benefits unrelated to the transactional value which they bring to their employers - is economically unsound.

Though a majority of people would disagree with this point, it is at least well understood by most libertarian and anarchist thinkers, as well as by any one who has ever run a business.

What is not widely understood, even by most Christian libertarians, is that this economically unsound principle is also grossly incorrect from a theological perspective, and that there is a cultural feedback loop between "minimum wage thinking" and destructive theologies of salvation and grace.

This cultural feedback loop perverts our sense of the intersection between the natural economic order and the economy of salvation, and inverts our sense of the individual's place in relationship to other individuals, the community, and God.

Central to the philosophical blind-spot allowing this cultural feedback loop to go unnoticed even by people with otherwise sound judgement in both economics and theology is a mischaracterization of minimum wage principles as somehow communitarian or socialist, in opposition to a more individualistic paradigm favored by most libertarian thinkers, when, in fact, the exact opposite is the case.

That is, a transactional paradigm of the employee-employer relationship is not only more economically sound, it is also more communitarian in its essence. On the other hand, the so-called "socialist" minimum wage paradigm is really a disguised version of the modern sin of individualism, a heresy which, paradoxically, reduces the ultimate value of the individual to precisely zero.

This essay will give a brief overview of the economic unsoundness of "minimum wage thinking" (for the benefit of the unconvinced) and then explore how this way of thinking has polluted our shared "embedded theology" of salvation. Finally, I will show that God's free gift of grace, like all relational interactions, is essentially transactional and that this transaction, rightly understood, does not reduce grace to the status of a commodity but rather exalts the human individual as the most valued creation in the eyes of God.

Firstly, with regards to Minimum Wage as a social construct, it must be said that there are, primarily, two ideas which contribute to the notion that instituting a society-wide minimum wage is beneficial or moral. The original impetus for minimum wage policies grew out of a larger framework of society-planning philosophies which stated that governments could, and should, institute policies which would shape the whole of society toward some desired end. While both deeply immoral and largely ineffective, it was at least somewhat reasonable to have thought (at that time) that this sort of thing was the rightful domain of democratically governments. However, as the rhetoric and spirit of the political left has turned away from social engineering and towards social justice, a second justification for minimum wage policies has developed.

This newer (and now, completely accepted) idea is simply that people *deserve* to be paid some amount, and no less. In this conception, there is some specific and knowable dollar amount associated with an hour of a human being's life. Paying somebody less than that amount is not just bad for society (for whatever reason), it is fraud and exploitation of an individual person. Since justice is concerned with giving people what they rightly deserve (as Aquinas defines, in part), and since people deserve some specific amount of money, the act of not paying people that amount of money is an injustice.

The core idea here - that a person's time must be worth some specific amount of money and no less, for the reason simply that they "deserve it" - I refer to as "Minimum Wage Thinking." While minimum wage policies are equally harmful, regardless of the reason they are created, and, while the society-planning impulse carries its own problems, I am here concerned primarily with this Minimum Wage Thinking, and the way this idea, which has now become the central theme of leftist labor ideology, negatively impacts our culture's embedded theology.

It shouldn't have to be said that the general effect of instituting a minimum wage is the exclusion from the marketplace of those whose labor falls below the value of that minimum wage. The main reason for this, of course, is that a declaration of what any individual person deserves - even if it is accepted and believed by all people - has very little impact on transactional monetary value. Even the most benevolent businesses do not set wages for their employees based on their intrinsic worth, but rather based on the monetary value that each employee brings to the organization (and, on average, the pay needs to be *less* than the value received, otherwise the business runs at a loss).

This exclusion, though hotly contested by proponents of minimum wage policies, can be seen in the disappearance of most forms of extremely-low-skill service labor such as baggers at grocery stores and table bussers at restaurants. And the fact that middle-class liberals are, in practice, unconvinced by their own arguments regarding the inelasticity of the "supply" of jobs is evidenced by an almost complete absence of domestic labor in modern life.

Naturally, this exclusion carries economic burdens for the most vulnerable members of our society: women, youth, immigrants, and the uneducated. But what about the spiritual and theological burden? And what about those who manage to actually get hired in jobs that pay minimum wage?

Minimum Wage Thinking is based on a form of justice which Aquinas calls "Distributive Justice."

>>The other [type of justice] consists in distribution, and is called distributive justice; whereby a ruler or a steward gives to each what his rank deserves. As then the proper order displayed in ruling a family or any kind of multitude evinces justice of this kind in the ruler, so the order of the universe, which is seen both in effects of nature and in effects of will, shows forth the justice of God.

This form of justice belongs properly to God and, secondarily, to human rulers.

(One assumes that distribution belongs to rulers inasmuch as they, like God, possess something which can be distributed to others for their personal benefit or for the benefit of the group over which the ruler has dominion. It would be a mistake, then, to use this definition as a justification for government officials to distribute that which does not belong to them but rather belongs to others. Moreover, it is fundamental to the entire conception of modern democracy that our elected officials are not rulers, but rather administrators, and so it would be improper to assign to them the privileges of rulers, in any case.)

In a Minimum Wage context, this distributive justice replaces the form of justice proper to human economic activity, what Aquinas (after Aristotle) refers to as "commutative justice."

>>There are two kinds of justice. The one consists in mutual giving and receiving, as in buying and selling, and other kinds of intercourse and exchange. This the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 4) calls commutative justice, that directs exchange and intercourse of business.

Note that the practical details of commerce are not replaced by divine, distributive Justice; only the mental framework for understanding these things has been changed. The hard laws of economic reality - primarily the fact that people will not engage in transactions which they do not see as beneficial - cannot be disrupted. In fact, in any case wherein someone willingly gives more in a transaction than they receive in perceived value, we do not classify that as a higher form of justice but as a different virtue altogether - charity.

From this essential mismatch - viewing the activities of commerce through the lens of distributive justice - flow a number of deleterious spiritual effects and erroneous theological conclusions.

The most obvious problem is the equating of monetary value with human worth and dignity. This wrong-headed equation flows directly out of the basis for Minimum Wage Thinking - human beings deserve, intrinsically, some specific amount of money per unit of time. The implication here is that human life has a monetary value that can be calculated. Regardless of the monetary or transactional value that a person brings into an employer-employee relationship, they are - according to this mindset - being paid for their mere existence, because they deserve it.

How then, with this understanding, can one account for the fact that some people are paid a great deal of money, while other people are paid minimum wage? In a realistic, commutative justice framework, the answer to this question is obvious: the employer thinks it is in their economic interest to pay this employee more than that employee. But in a universe that pays people because of their intrinsic worth, the only possible answer is that some people are intrinsically worth more than others.

This notion of deserving and undeserving is a long-standing cultural problem in the United States, and is so embedded that even many opponents of minimum wage increases defend their (usually angry) rhetoric by stating that low-skilled workers don't "deserve" any more than they are currently getting.

Obviously, the idea that some people are intrinsically worth more than other people, that some deserve more while others deserve less, is a perversion of both Christian morality and secular humanist ethics. And, while the temporal consequences of this error are felt primarily by the poor, it is largely the "deserving" rich who reap the rotten spiritual fruits.

The number of instance of tragically-comic irony in this whole affair are too many to dwell on, as is usually the case whenever there is a massive intersection between the Law of Unintended Consequences and the phenomenon of Pathological Altruism. One in particular that is worth noting is that (despite their origin in racist eugenic social engineering) our modern minimum wage partisans usually denounce both the massive class gulf that separates low-wage workers (and the unemployable) from the wealthy and the obvious difference in worth and value attributed to the exalted rich and the discarded poor, and yet - in an attempt to rectify the situation caused by all this inequality and denigration - succeed only in reinforcing the destructive notion that one's material wealth is related to one's human worth.

And it is not only that Minimum Wage Thinking stratifies the perception of human value in a quantitative manner (some are worth more or less), but also in a profoundly qualitative manner as well. That is, it seems that our current system, in addition to communicating that some people are better than others, also communicates that some people are an entirely different sort of person than others are.

This happens in two very related ways.

First, as stated above, distributive justice belongs properly to God and secondarily to rulers.
