The conception behind minimum wage laws - and any similar notion that supposes that employees should receive payment or benefits unrelated to the transactional value which they bring to their employers - is economically unsound.

Though a majority of people would disagree with this point, it is at least well understood by most libertarian and anarchist thinkers, as well as by any one who has ever run a business.

What is not widely understood, even by most Christian libertarians, is that this economically unsound principle is also grossly incorrect from a theological perspective, and that there is a cultural feedback loop between "minimum wage thinking" and destructive theologies of salvation and grace.

This cultural feedback loop perverts our sense of the intersection between the natural economic order and the economy of salvation, and inverts our sense of the individual's place in relationship to other individuals, the community, and God.

Central to the philosophical blind-spot allowing this cultural feedback loop to go unnoticed even by people with otherwise sound judgement in both economics and theology is a mischaracterization of minimum wage principles as somehow communitarian or socialist, in opposition to a more individualistic paradigm favored by most libertarian thinkers, when, in fact, the exact opposite is the case.

That is, a transactional paradigm of the employee-employer relationship is not only more economically sound, it is also more communitarian in its essence. On the other hand, the so-called "socialist" minimum wage paradigm is really a disguised version of the modern sin of individualism, a heresy which, paradoxically, reduces the ultimate value of the individual to precisely zero.

This essay will give a brief overview of the economic unsoundness of "minimum wage thinking" (for the benefit of the unconvinced) and then explore how this way of thinking has polluted our shared "embedded theology" of salvation. Finally, I will show that God's free gift of grace, like all relational interactions, is essentially transactional and that this transaction, rightly understood, does not reduce grace to the status of a commodity but rather exalts the human individual as the most valued creation in the eyes of God.
